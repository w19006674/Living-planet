            <h1>Oauth description</h1>
            <p>OAuth (Open Authorization) is a framework that is designed to allow a website or app to access resources hosted by other web apps on behalf of a user. Google OAuth uses OAuth 2.0 and will allow a user access once they sign in with a Google account.</p>
            <h1>What is the OAuth process? - Front-end</h1>
            <p>User will request access to a third party application, if they are not signed in they will then be redirected to the sign in page hosted by Google where they will then sign in, once they have signed in, they will be given access. Once they have signed out, they will be redirected back to the home page.</p>
            <h1>What is the OAuth process? - back-end</h1>
            <p>User will request access to a third party application which will check if the user has a token, if the user does not have a token then the app will authenticate the user, however if they do not have a token then the user will be redirected to the Google sign in page. The user will then be authorised and given a token, once they have been given a token they will be redirected back to the third party application and allowed access to it. Once the user signs out, the token will then be destroyed and they will be redirected back to the home page.</p> 
            <h1>Why is OAuth more secure than an API key?</h1>
            <p>OAuth is more secure as it does not require users to provide their details directly to third party organizations, this in turn greatly reduces the risk of credential exposure.</p>
